**Project:** SteadyLetters - AI-Powered Physical Letter Sending SaaS
**Initialized:** January 20, 2026
**Status:** Active Development - Phase 6+ (Mobile & Security)

---

## SESSION 1: INITIALIZER AGENT - Project Setup
**Date:** January 20, 2026
**Agent:** Initializer
**Goal:** Set up autonomous coding environment and verify feature tracking

### Actions Completed:
1. ✅ Analyzed existing project structure
2. ✅ Verified feature_list.json (71 features total: 31 complete, 40 pending)
3. ✅ Reviewed comprehensive PRD documentation
4. ✅ Identified current development phase (Phase 6: Mobile Optimization)
5. ✅ Created claude-progress.txt session log

### Project Assessment:

**Current State:**
- Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript application
- 31/71 features completed (Phases 1-5 mostly done)
- Core functionality working: AI generation, Templates, Recipients, Orders, Billing
- Production deployment on Vercel with Supabase backend
- 48+ test files (Jest + Playwright)

**Immediate Priorities (Next 10-20 Features):**
Phase 6 - Mobile Optimization (10 features):
  - MOB-001: Mobile Hamburger Menu (HIGH)
  - MOB-002: Mobile Menu Overlay (HIGH)
  - MOB-003: Touch Target Utility (HIGH)
  - MOB-004: iOS Input Zoom Fix (HIGH)
  - MOB-005: Safe Area Insets (MEDIUM)
  - MOB-006 to MOB-010: Page-specific mobile responsiveness

Phase 7 - Security Hardening (8 features):
  - SEC-001: Thanks.io Webhook Signature Verification (HIGH)
  - SEC-002 to SEC-005: Rate Limiting Setup
  - SEC-006: Security Headers
  - SEC-007: Input Validation Schemas
  - SEC-008: Order Send Usage Check

**Technical Debt:**
- Webhook signature verification missing
- Usage limits not enforced before order creation
- Mobile navigation incomplete
- Rate limiting not implemented

### Documentation Found:
- ✅ feature_list.json - Comprehensive feature tracking
- ✅ DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md - Detailed project overview
- ✅ PRD_STATUS_REPORT.md - Current implementation status
- ✅ PRD_MOBILE_OPTIMIZATION.md - Mobile requirements
- ✅ PRD_SECURITY_HARDENING.md - Security requirements
- ✅ PRD_OBSERVABILITY.md - Monitoring requirements
- ✅ package.json - All dependencies listed
- ✅ README.md - Basic Next.js setup info

### Environment Configuration:
Required environment variables documented in DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md:
- Database: DATABASE_URL
- Supabase: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, keys
- OpenAI: OPENAI_API_KEY
- Stripe: Multiple keys and webhook secret
- Thanks.io: THANKS_IO_API_KEY

### Next Steps for Future Agents:
1. Start with MOB-001 (Mobile Hamburger Menu) - src/components/navbar.tsx
2. Follow with MOB-002 through MOB-004 (Mobile CSS utilities)
3. Then tackle SEC-001 (Webhook signature verification)
4. Systematically work through remaining 40 features

### File Structure Verified:

│   ├── app/                 # Next.js pages and API routes
│   │   ├── actions/         # Server actions (CRUD) - ✅ Complete
│   │   ├── api/             # API endpoints - ✅ Most complete
│   │   └── [pages]/         # Route pages - ✅ Core pages done
│   ├── components/          # React components - ⚠️ Needs mobile work

│   │   ├── navbar.tsx       # ⚠️ Needs hamburger menu
│   │   └── voice-recorder.tsx
│   └── lib/                 # Utilities and integrations - ✅ Mostly complete
├── prisma/                  # Database schema - ✅ Complete
├── tests/                   # 48+ test files - ✅ Comprehensive
└── PRD_*.md                 # Product requirements - ✅ Well documented
```

### Recommendations:
1. Focus on mobile optimization first (user-facing, high impact)
2. Then security hardening (critical for production)
3. Then observability features (monitoring and analytics)
4. Save future features (bulk send, CSV import) for later phases
